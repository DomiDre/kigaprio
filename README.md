## 📋 Overview

PrioTag is a secure web application designed for a single childcare facility to manage daily priorities with server-side encryption. It enables parents to submit childcare preferences while ensuring complete data privacy through user-controlled encryption and GDPR-compliant architecture.

### Key Capabilities
- 🔐 **Server-side encryption** with user-controlled security levels
- 📊 **Administrative reporting** with Excel generation for monthly overviews
- 👥 **Multi-role support** for parents and administrators
- 🛡️ **GDPR-compliant** data handling and storage
- 📱 **Responsive design** for mobile and desktop access
- ✅ **Verifiable builds** with signed Docker images and transparency

## 🔍 Build Verification

PrioTag implements comprehensive build verification to ensure transparency and trust:

- **🔐 Signed Docker Images**: All production images are cryptographically signed with [Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/)
- **📋 SBOM Generation**: Complete Software Bill of Materials for every build
- **🔗 Source Linking**: Every deployment links to its exact source code commit
- **👁️ Public CI/CD**: All builds happen in auditable [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/DomiDre/priotag/actions)
- **🌐 User Verification**: Visit `/verify` on any deployment to confirm authenticity

**Quick Verification:**
```bash
# Verify the backend Docker image signature
cosign verify \
  --certificate-identity-regexp='https://github.com/DomiDre/priotag' \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  ghcr.io/domidre/priotag-backend:latest
```

For complete verification instructions, see **[VERIFICATION.md](VERIFICATION.md)**.

## 🏗️ Architecture

PrioTag implements a privacy-first architecture with multiple layers of security. For detailed technical documentation, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

| **Monitoring** | Prometheus              | Active monitoring for malicious access attempts with e-mail alert |
| **Container**  | Docker + Docker Compose | Consistent deployment environment                                 |

### Security Model

When registering, a data encryption key (DEK) is generated and stored once encrypted by the user password and once by the public key of the administration. 
To read and write data the DEK is send at login together with the session token as httpOnly cookie.
For proper data validation and to rely on proper encryption libraries, the encryption happens server-side during a request.

Details in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker Engine ≥ 24.0
- Docker Compose ≥ 2.20
- [just](https://github.com/casey/just) command runner
- 2 GB available RAM (usage actually < 500 MB)
- 3 GB available disk space

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DomiDre/priotag.git
cd priotag
```

2. **Start development environment**
```bash
# Build development containers
just dev-build

# Start all services (FastAPI, SvelteKit, PocketBase, Redis)
just dev
```

3. **Access the application**
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/api/docs
- PocketBase Admin: http://localhost:8090/_/

### Production Deployment

1. **Initialize environment**
```bash
# Generate secure secrets
just init-secrets

# Initialize PocketBase storage
just pocketbase-init
```

On a local device perform
```bash
just init-admin-key
```
to generate public/private key pair. Move public key to server and keep private key safe.

Run
```bash
just services-init
```
to generate folders with proper permissions and seperate user + groups for each service.


2. **Deploy**
```bash
# Build production images
just build

# Start production services
just prod
```
